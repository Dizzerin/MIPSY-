Change regex so instructions with no arguments work (i.e. syscall)
^ can do this by removing all regex related checking on instruction lines and just always assume any line that doesn't
match any of the other types is an instruction,
then let the program lookup that line later and see if it is a valid instruction, this is currently done anyways
would also need to make sure the regex matching a label with an instruction does match something like "label: syscall"
quickest way to do this is make the regex instruction match any line that starts with a-Z, but would need to make sure
that check is done last, since labels start the same way
